Sold to a bid then hit by a buyer
Lift the lid on a kids took the piss then retire
Paris said she get underhand
She always let you down when she knows that she can
Like a SA80, my baby save me
Even played me and jammed in a sand
Like a essay, she tried to correct me
She meant to protect me but only betrayed me now
